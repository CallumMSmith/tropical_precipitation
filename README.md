# tropical_precipitation
Code to analyse the change in precipitation due tropical forest loss. This analysis forms the publication "Tropical forest loss causes large reductions in observed precipitation", which has been accepted for publication in Nature.

The files in this repository take freely available precipitation, land cover and forest loss datasets and analyse the impact of tropical forest loss on these precipitation datasets. Firstly the precipitation, land cover and forest loss datasets are processed and regridded to a range of spatial scales. The datasets are then analysed to observe the changes in precipitation over time and to compare deforested regions with nearby forest. Lastly these results are plotted in a series of ways to explore these changes.

Files:
analysis_scripy.py - takes the precipitation data and runs analysis to examine the local change in P.
